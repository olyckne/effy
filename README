# INSTALLATION

1. Download
2. Upload to your server
3. Edit .htaccess and set correct RewriteBase
4. Run the site, there is a (pretty bad for now) setup.php that will run.
It will guide you home, I hope. The database works sometimes, and sometimes not, for some reason.
If it doesn't work you need to create the tables etc yourself, look in the setup.php file.
Yeah, it sucks. Gonna fix asap!
5. go to you url/admin and login in with user "admin" password "admin".

Optional:
6. You could create a Controller.php with a class Controller extends BaseController. If you do all other controllers will extend your Controller. You see the power, right?
